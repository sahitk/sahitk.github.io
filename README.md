I'm **Sahit Kavukuntla**, a first-year [Computer Science](https://scs.gatech.edu/) major at [Georgia Institute of Technology](gatech.edu). My threads are [Intelligence](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/intelligence), [Systems & Architecture](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/systems-architecture)), and [Theory](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/intelligence), and I am part of the [Honors Program](http://honorsprogram.gatech.edu/). I am from San Jose, CA, and I graduated from Archbishop Mitty High School. At Mitty, I led Tech Team, a student-run organization through our IT Department dedicated to maintaining and servicing the Apple devices across campus, staffing school events, and providing visual and audio interfaces for assemblies, fundraisers, and outreach events. I was also a Subsystems Lead and Strategy Lead on Mitty's FRC Robotics team, [TKO 1351](https://www.amhsrobotics.com). And in my free time, I would volunteer at my local library and hospital, or read sci-fi and fantasy books.
