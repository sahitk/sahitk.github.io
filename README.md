I'm **Sahit Kavukuntla**, a sophomore [Computer Science](https://scs.gatech.edu/) major at [Georgia Institute of Technology](gatech.edu). My threads are [Intelligence](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/intelligence), [Systems & Architecture](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/systems-architecture), and [Theory](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/intelligence), and I am part of the [Honors Program](https://honorsprogram.gatech.edu/).

I am from San Jose, CA, and I graduated from Archbishop Mitty High School. At Mitty, I led Tech Team, a student-run organization through our IT Department dedicated to maintaining and servicing the Apple devices across campus, staffing school events, and providing visual and audio interfaces for assemblies, fundraisers, and outreach events. I was also a Subsystems Lead and Strategy Lead on Mitty's FRC Robotics team, [TKO 1351](https://www.amhsrobotics.com). And in my free time, I would volunteer at my local library and hospital, or read science fiction and fantasy books.

I'm currently seeking a summer internship in software engineering, data science, or machine learning so I can put what I learn in the classroom to use. You can read more about me at my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sahit-k/), and view my latest resume [here](https://sahitk.com/Sahit_Kavukuntla_Resume.pdf). You can look at examples of my code through the link on the left below my name. Please send me an email to view my code from any of my classes at Georgia Tech.

I can be contacted through my [email](mailto:sahitk@gatech.edu) or [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/sahitkavukuntla/).
