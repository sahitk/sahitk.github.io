## A little bit about me:

My name is Sahit Kavukuntla, I am a freshman at [Georgia Institute of Technology](gatech.edu), I am a [Computer Science](https://scs.gatech.edu/) major (with threads in [Intelligence](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/intelligence) and [Systems & Architecture](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/systems-architecture)), and I am part of the [Honors Program](http://honorsprogram.gatech.edu/). I am from San Jose, CA, and I graduated from Archbishop Mitty High School. At Mitty I led Tech Team, a student-run organization dedicated to maintaining and servicing the Apple devices across campus, staffing school events, and providing visual and audio interfaces for assemblies, fundraisers, and outreach events. I was also a Subsystems Lead and Strategy Lead on Mitty's FRC Robotics team, TKO 1351. And in my free time, I would volunteer at my local library and hospital.

You can read more about me at my [LinkedIn](www.linkedin.com/in/sahit-k). I'm working on getting my résumé on here.

The rest of this website is still a work in progress, so please be patient! I will certainly be editing it in the future.

I can be contacted through my [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/sahitkavukuntla/) or [email](mailto:skavukuntla@gatech.edu).
